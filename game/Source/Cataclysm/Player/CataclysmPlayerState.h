/**
 * Owns the player's ability system component and attribute sets.
 *
 * WHY THE PLAYER STATE AND NOT THE PAWN.
 *
 * The design has the player die and respawn at the capital, at a cost of 5 to 15
 * days depending on difficulty. Death is a routine, repeated event, not the end
 * of a session. A pawn is destroyed on death; the player state is not.
 *
 * Putting the ability system on the pawn would mean every death destroyed the
 * player's attributes, active effects, cooldowns and granted abilities, and all
 * of it would have to be saved and restored by hand. On the player state, it
 * simply survives.
 *
 * Enemies do the opposite and own their component on the pawn, because an enemy
 * that dies is gone.
